# Survey Correlation Analysis Report

We gathered data from a class survey that consisted of personal preferences and facts of each student (i.e., GPA, classes they were taking, hobbies, homework habits, music taste, etc.). However, we focused our analysis on the data that pertains to our primary objective. We decided to concentrate our project on the correlation between a student's music preferences and whether they go to the gym. Our goal was to investigate whether particular music genres have stronger associations with students having specific workout preferences and fitness goals, as well as their frequency. More specifically, we wanted to see if specific music genres are more heavily associated with those with particular workout or fitness goals and how frequently/infrequently they go to the gym. Using visualizations, we explored potential correlations between gym and music variables. Subsequently, we conducted Cramer's V and chi-square analyses to test our hypotheses related to our area of study. While some visualizations displayed skewness, indicating potential correlations, statistical tests revealed no statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
