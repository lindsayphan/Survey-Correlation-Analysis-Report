# Survey-Correlation-Analysis-Report

We gathered data from a class survey that consisted of peresonal preferences and facts of each student (i.e. gpa, classes they were taking, hobbies, homework habits, music taste, etc). However, we focused our analysis on the data that pertains to our main objective. We decided to concentrate our project on the correlation between a student's music preferences and if they go to the gym. Our goal was to investigate whether particular music genres have stronger associations with students having specific workout preferences and fitness goals, as well as their frequency. More specifically, we wanted to see if certian music genres are more heavily associated with those that have a specific workout, fitness goals, and how frequently/unfrequently they go to the gym. Using visualizations, we explored potential correaltions between gym and music variables. Subsequently, we conducted Cramer's V and chi-square analyses to test our hypotheses related to our area of study. While some visualizations displayed skewness indicating potential correlations, statistical tests revealed that there were no statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
